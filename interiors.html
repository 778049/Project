				<h1>   	<u><b>INTERIOR DESIGN</b></u>
</h1>
<p><span>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. </span><emp>An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections,</emp> programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.</p>

				<img src="I1.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p>In the past, interiors were put together <emp>instinctively as a part of the process </emp>of building.

<span>The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society </span>and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.</p>
				<img src="I2.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p>The <emp>pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession.</emp><span>The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore,</span> strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.</p>
<img src="I3.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p>In ancient India, architects would also function as interior designers. This can be seen from the <emp>references of Vishwakarma the architect—one of the gods in Indian mythology. In these architects' design of 17th-century Indian homes, sculptures depicting ancient texts </emp><span>and events are seen inside the palaces, while during the medieval times wall art paintings were a common feature of palace-like mansions in India commonly known as havelis. </span>While most traditional homes have been demolished to make way to modern buildings, there are still around 2000 havelis in the Shekhawati region of Rajashtan that display wall art paintings.</p>

				<img src="I4.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p>In ancient Egypt, "soul houses" (or models of houses) were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings. <span>From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences</span><emp> throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.</emp></p>
<img src="I5.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p>Painting interior walls has existed for at least 5,000 <span>years, with examples found as far north as the Ness of Brodgar,as have templated interiors, as seen in the associated Skara Brae settlement.</span><emp>It was the Greeks, and later Romans who added co-ordinated, decorative mosaics floors, and templated bath houses, shops, civil offices, Castra (forts) and temple, interiors,</emp><span> in the first millennia BC. With specialised guilds dedicated to producing interior decoration,</span> and formulaic furniture, in buildings constructed to forms defined by Roman architects, such as Vitruvius: De architectura, libri decem (The Ten Books on Architecture).</p>

				<img src="I6.jpeg" alt="can't display"><p><emp>Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century,</emp><span>interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed upholsterer or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space.</span> Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.</p>
